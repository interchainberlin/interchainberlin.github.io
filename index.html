    <h1>Interchain GmbH</h1>
    <h3>Building the internet of blockchains</h3>
    <p>
        At Interchain GmbH, we are responsible for stewarding some of the most foundational infrastructure for
        blockchain ecosystems. Our work helps secure [billions of dollars](https://cosmos-cap.com) in value across a variety of major
        blockchain projects, including <a href="https://cosmos.network">Cosmos</a>, and we are pioneering new protocols
        for interoperability across the entire blockchain ecosystem. Our vision is to create a new interconnected
        ecosystem, a new internet of blockchains: The Interchain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our products include
        <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint">Tendermint Core</a>,
        a groundbreaking, Byzantine-fault tolerant consensus protocol;
        <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ics">the Inter Blockchain Communication protocol</a>, a
        reliable, ordered, authenticated cross-ledger data transport protocol; and
        <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/gaia">Gaia</a>, the software that powers the Cosmos Hub.

    <h2>Join Us</h2>
    <p>
        All of our work is open source, and we code primarily in Go. We design protocols and architect systems, while
        working closely with a variety of external contributors and users from around the world. If you like working
        with distributed systems, databases, blockchain protocols, or cryptography, we think you might like working with
        us!
    </p>
    <p>We value professionalism, kindness, experience and curiosity. We work hard to communicate clearly and with
        empathy, and our team has a knack for building stable distributed systems while also finding new ways to
        integrate cutting-edge technologies. We are an engineering-driven culture: All of our work is open source, and
        we limit our meetings so that our team can focus on building great systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team is multicultural and values diversity, and we make decisions in a collaborative and transparent way.
        We're a small team, growing quickly, positioned in the center of one of the largest and most promising
        blockchain ecosystems. We are a non-profit, and in some ways, we resemble a collective more than a traditional
        software startup. But we’re not too crunchy: Because our software helps secure billions of dollars in
        value, we’re able to offer salaries that are competitive in a global market, along with a variety of other
        benefits and perks.
